# GPT Developer

This is a project inspired by gpt-engineer https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer
But instead of a python application running localy, this is a client side browser single page application developed in Vue.js powered by Vuetify.

Specify what you want it to build, the AI asks for clarification, and then builds it.
The generated files will be available to download at the end of the process.

The application asks you to input your Open AI API KEY
available at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
